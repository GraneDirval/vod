# DeviceAtlas Enterprise #

Welcome to the DeviceAtlas Enterprise API.

The API is designed to be easy to implement and use. To get an
instance of an API working with your system, only two components are required:

* The API Library files - To perform the look ups based on the headers presented
  by the visiting browser.
* A Data file - To hold the device data.

The Data file is updated daily and can be retrieved from the
https://deviceatlas.com website, manually or using a script. Once implemented in
your infrastructure, you will have the ability to identify thousands of devices
per second, without depending on any external systems or services.
Following this documentation, it should take you no longer than 30 minutes to
implement an API in your environment, using the sample code provided to get
started. If you are having trouble implementing any of our APIs, please contact
us at <support@deviceatlas.com> and our support team will be happy to assist you.

The following items are available in
this package:


### Device Detection API ###

The DeviceAtlas Device Detection API provides a way to detect devices based on
the HTTP headers. Using the headers, the API returns device information such as
screen width, screen height, is mobile, vendor, model etc.
[Read more...](README.DeviceApi.html)


### Device Detection API Config ###

DeviceAtlas DeviceApi Config class provides options to customize the API
behaviour in terms of memory use, caching, performance and device properties.
[Read more...](README.DeviceApi-Config.html)


### Device Detection API Upgrade ###

This document is for users who are already using a DeviceAtlas DeviceAPI version
prior to 2.0. There are three scenarios that may be considered.
[Read more...](README.Upgrade.html)


### Carrier Identification API ###

The DeviceAtlas Carrier Identification API provides a way to lookup Mobile
Carrier properties based on an IPv4 IP address. Using the IP address for a
Mobile Carrier the API will return properties such as _networkOperator_,
_networkBrand_, _countryCode_, _mcc_ and _mnc_.
[Read more...](README.CarrierApi.html)


### Client-side Component ###

The DeviceAtlas APIs can work in conjunction with a JavaScript property
detection file and merge the resulting properties for use on the server side.
The client properties are also available to other JavaScript libraries. The
DeviceAtlas client detection file needs to be included on your web page for this
to function.
[Read more...](README.ClientSide.html)


### Connectivity Analyser ###

The DeviceAtlas Connectivity Analyser is used to measure the round trip time when
sending a payload of a fixed size to a client. This measures a combination of
latency and bandwidth. The measured time is then used to categorize the
client's current connection into low, medium or high.
