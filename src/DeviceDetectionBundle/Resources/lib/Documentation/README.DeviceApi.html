# DeviceAtlas Device Detection API #

The DeviceAtlas Device Detection API provides a way to detect devices based on
the HTTP headers. Using the headers, the API returns device information such as
screen width, screen height, is mobile, vendor, model etc.

To see a full list of properties in DeviceAtlas please visit:
https://deviceatlas.com/resources/available-properties .



### Data File ###

The DeviceAtlas API relies on a device data file to function. DeviceAtlas
provides daily data file updates so it is recommended to download the data file
on a regular basis. This can be done manually from your account page or
automated via the https://deviceatlas.com/getJSON page.

For more information please see:
https://deviceatlas.com/resources/getting-the-data



### Dependencies ###
This library does not depend on any third party libraries.



### Library ###
The DeviceAtlas Device Detection API consists of four libraries as below:


#### DeviceAtlas Common (Api/) ####
  Contains the shared libraries which are common between the DeviceAtlas APIs.
  When using the DeviceApi and DeviceApiWeb, the required files from this library
  will be included automatically by the API. Keep the relative paths of the
  libraries as they are in the downloaded package.

#### DeviceApi (Api/Device/Mobi_Mtld_Da_Device_DeviceApi) ####
  The main DeviceApi that loads the Device data and detects and returns the
  properties for a set of request headers or the user-agent. Client-side
  properties can be optionally passed to this library to get more accurate
  results.

#### DeviceApiWeb (Api/Device/Mobi_Mtld_Da_Device_DeviceApiWeb) ####
  A small extension to the main API that allows automatic extraction of the
  request headers and client-side properties from the request. It is preferred to
  use this library for real-time device detections in web applications.

#### CacheProvider (Api/CacheProvider/) ####
  Contains an interface for cache-provider classes that can be used with the
  DeviceApi and DeviceApiWeb. Also contains three classes which implement the
  interfaces for APC, Memcache and a file-cache.



### The 2.x API Interface ###

* This is the new standard interface, common across the DeviceAtlas APIs.

* This interface is intended to be simple to use, as the interface includes
  custom objects for getting the detected property set and getting a single
  property value.

* Unlike the former interface, this interface is not a set of static methods.
  This allows the interface to have more encapsulation, requiring fewer and
  simpler methods. This new API is highly maintainable and flexible for future
  improvements and new features.

* The DeviceApiWeb extension makes it possible to do device lookups based on the
  request or a whole set of HTTP headers. This allows the API to make a more
  precise detection and return properties with more accurate values. For example,
  some browsers distribute the user-agent information into different headers, so
  it is almost impossible to correctly detect the device properties, such as type
  and model from the user-agent header itself. With this new interface, the API
  is able to overcome these situations.



### Basic Usage ###
The API can be used as follows:

* Inside a web application.
  To lookup the properties of the device which sent the request:

    ```php

    // the detection is done based on the current HTTP request

    require_once "/path/to/Api/Device/DeviceApiWeb.php";

    /* (1) create an instance with default API configs */
    $deviceApi = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_DeviceApiWeb();

    /* (2) load the data file */
    try {
        $deviceApi->loadDataFromFile("/path/to/datafile.json");
    } catch (Exception $x) {
        // handle the exceptions related to loading the data file
    }

    /* (3) look up device properties */
    $properties = $deviceApi->getProperties();

    /* (4) use the properties - e.g. detect mobile device  */

    // if there is a property named "mobileDevice" and the value is true
    if ($properties->contains("mobileDevice", true)) {

        // example 1: Get the screen width for image optimization
        $displayWidth = $properties->containsKey("displayWidth")?
            $properties->get("displayWidth")->asInteger(): 100;

        // example 2: Get the device vendor name
        $vendor = $properties->containsKey("vendor")?
            $properties->get("vendor")->asString(): "";

        // example 3: Touch screen optimization
        $useBiggerIcons = $properties->contains("touchScreen", true);

        // example 4: Send Geo Location JS to client?
        $supportsGeoLocation = $properties->contains("js.geoLocation", true);

        // example 5: The Properties class implements the magic __get so you can:
        // if property does not exists then the value will be null
        // otherwise you get a typed value
        $model         = $properties->model;         // null or string
        $isTablet      = $properties->isTablet;      // null or boolean
        $displayHeight = $properties->displayHeight; // null or integer
    }
    ```

* Not in a web application or not for real-time device lookups.
  To lookup the properties by manually passing the headers to the API:
  Note that the DeviceApiWeb is an extension of DeviceApi so all the
  functionality shown below is also available in DeviceApiWeb.

    ```php

    // the detection is done based on (HTTP headers) or user-agent string

    require_once "/path/to/Api/Device/DeviceApi.php";

    /* (1) create an instance with default API configs */
    $deviceApi = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_DeviceApi();

    /* (2) load the data file */
    try {
        $deviceApi->loadDataFromFile("/path/to/datafile.json");
    } catch (Exception $x) {
        // handle the exceptions related to loading the data file
    }

    /* (3) look up device properties by HTTP headers */
    $headers = array(
        "HEADER NAME" => "HEADER VALUE",
    );
    $properties = $deviceApi->getProperties($headers);

    /* (3) look up device properties by user-agent string */
    $userAgent = "THE USER AGENT VALUE";
    $properties = $deviceApi->getProperties($userAgent);

    /* (4) use the properties - e.g. detect mobile device  */

    // if there is a property named "mobileDevice" and the value is true
    if ($properties->contains("mobileDevice", true)) {

        // example 1: Get the screen width for image optimization
        $displayWidth = $properties->containsKey("displayWidth")?
            $properties->get("displayWidth")->asInteger(): 100;

        // example 2: Get the device vendor name
        $vendor = $properties->containsKey("vendor")?
            $properties->get("vendor")->asString(): "";

        // example 3: Touch screen optimization
        $useBiggerIcons = $properties->contains("touchScreen", true);

        // example 4: Send Geo Location JS to client?
        $supportsGeoLocation = $properties->contains("js.geoLocation", true);

        // example 5: The Properties class implements the magic __get so you can:
        // if property does not exists then the value will be null
        // otherwise you get a typed value
        $model         = $properties->model;         // null or string
        $isTablet      = $properties->isTablet;      // null or boolean
        $displayHeight = $properties->displayHeight; // null or integer
    }
    ```



### Client-side Component ###
In addition to the properties from the data file, properties can be gathered
from the client's browser and used both on the client side and on the server
side. Please see the client side readme file for more information.


#### Usage With Client-side Component ####
In addition to normal usage, DeviceAtlas has the capability to capture client
side properties and merge them into the server side properties.

The "deviceatlas.min.js" file must be included on your webpage in order for it
to detect the client side properties. The client side properties are returned to
the server in a cookie called DAPROPS. The contents of this cookie are
automatically detected with the request headers or can be passed separately,
with Headers or a User-Agent, to get the combined properties back.. Both sets of
properties are used in additional logic to determine other properties such
iPhone and iPad models which are normally not detectable.

* Inside a web application.
  To lookup the properties of the device which sent the request:

    ```php

    // the detection is done based on the HTTP request

    /* (1) create an instance with default API configs */
    $deviceApi = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_DeviceApiWeb();

    /* (2) load the data file */
    try {
        $deviceApi->loadDataFromFile("/path/to/datafile.json");
    } catch (Exception $x) {
        // handle the exceptions related to loading the data file
    }

    /* (3) look up device properties */
    $properties = $deviceApi->getProperties();

    /* (4) use the properties - e.g. detect mobile device  */

    // if there is a property named "mobileDevice" and the value is true
    if ($properties->contains("mobileDevice", true)) {

        // example 1: Get the screen width for image optimization
        $displayWidth = $properties->displayWidth;

        // example 2: Get the device vendor name
        $vendor = $properties->containsKey("vendor")?
            $properties->get("vendor")->asString(): "";

        // example 3: Touch screen optimization
        $useBiggerIcons = $properties->contains("touchScreen", true);

        // example 4: Send Geo Location JS to client?
        $supportsGeoLocation = $properties->contains("js.geoLocation", true);

        // example 5: Get the device orientation (degrees)
        $deviceOrientation = $properties->containsKey("bjs.deviceOrientation")?
            $properties->get("bjs.deviceOrientation")->asInteger(): 0;
    }
    ```

* Not in a web application or not for real-time device lookups.
  To lookup the properties by manually passing the headers and the client-side
  properties to the API:
  Note that the DeviceApiWeb is an extension of DeviceApi so all functionalities
  shown below are also available in DeviceApiWeb.

    ```php

    // the detection is done based on (HTTP headers) or user-agent string

    /* (1) create an instance with default API configs */
    $deviceApi = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_DeviceApi();

    /* (2) load the data file */
    try {
        $deviceApi->loadDataFromFile("/path/to/datafile.json");
    } catch (Exception $x) {
        // handle the exceptions related to loading the data file
    }

    /* (3) look up device properties by HTTP headers */
    $clientSide = "PROPERTY1:VALUE1|PROPERTY2:VALUE2|PROPERTY3:VALUE3";

    $headers = array(
        "HEADER NAME" => "HEADER VALUE",
    );
    $properties = $deviceApi->getProperties($headers, $clientSide);

    /* (3) look up device properties by user-agent string */
    $userAgent = "THE USER AGENT VALUE";
    $properties = $deviceApi->getProperties($userAgent, $clientSide);

    /* (4) use the properties - e.g. detect mobile device  */

    // if there is a property named "mobileDevice" and the value is true
    if ($properties->contains("mobileDevice", true)) {

        // example 1: Get the screen width for image optimization
        $displayWidth = $properties->displayWidth;

        // example 2: Get the device vendor name
        $vendor = $properties->containsKey("vendor")?
            $properties->get("vendor")->asString(): "";

        // example 3: Touch screen optimization
        $useBiggerIcons = $properties->contains("touchScreen", true);

        // example 4: Send Geo Location JS to client?
        $supportsGeoLocation = $properties->contains("js.geoLocation", true);

        // example 5: Get the device orientation (degrees)
        int deviceOrientation = $properties->containsKey("bjs.deviceOrientation")?
            $properties->get("bjs.deviceOrientation")->asInteger(): 0;
    }
    ```



### Examples ###
Various examples are included in this package to clearly demonstrate the API
features, usage and some use cases. These examples are very simple and are
heavily commented.

#### Basic Usage ####
Includes six examples. Three simple command line examples which
use DeviceApi to detect and get properties from header sets and client-side
component. These examples show how the headers and client-side components
help getting precise property values from Opera mini browsers and iPhone
devices. Three simple web examples to be used in a web application. These
examples use the DeviceAtlasWeb and the request object to automatically detect
and get the properties for the request. Using the client-side-component is shown
in these web examples.

#### Redirection ####
This web example uses the DeviceApiWeb to get properties for
the current request and then uses some basic property values to decide which
website provides the most suitable content for the device making the request.

#### Content Adaptation ####
This web example uses the DeviceApiWeb to get properties for the device making
the current request and then uses some basic property values to choose a suitable
template to wrap around the content.

#### Analytics ####
This web example uses the DeviceApi to get properties for user-agents from a
given list. Some properties such as vendor, browser name and device type are
aggregated and the results are displayed as graphs and numbers.

#### Content Targeting ####
This example uses the DeviceApiWeb to detect the device and use some of its
properties to show certain advertisements and download links which may be
related or of interest to the user, considering his/her device.
This is a web example.

Note that in the web examples which use the DeviceApiWeb, the client side
properties are taken into account automatically by the API if the cookie exists
on the browser. This means if the cookie already exists within your browser you
will still see the client side properties in a getProperties call which has not
included the DeviceAtlas client side component. You can delete the cookie
manually to see the differences between the results from examples which use the
client side component and those that don't.

To run the web application examples, follow these steps:

* Edit the example files and update the data file path.
* Run the CLI examples from command line.
* Run the web applications in a browser http://yourwebserver/ExampleName/ .



### Upgrading ###
If you are currently using a DeviceAtlas Enterprise API version prior to 2.0.
Please see the [Upgrade readme file](README.Upgrade.html) for more information.



### Optimizations ###
When the DeviceApi or DeviceApiWeb are used in a stateless environment such as in
a Web Server, the data file has to be loaded on each request because PHP is
a stateless language. While this works, it greatly impacts performance. To
address this issue this API provides two ways to optimize the memory usage and
lookup performance.

#### Data File Optimization ####
It is highly recommended to use the data file optimizer. The optimizer breaks
the data file into smaller parts and caches them on the disk. The API will use
the cached data instead and will only lead the data needed for a certain lookup
into the memory.

```php
    $config = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_Config();
    $config->setUseTreeOptimizer(true);

    $deviceApi = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_DeviceApiWeb($config);

    try {
        $deviceApi->loadDataFromFile("/path/to/datafile.json");
    } catch (Exception $x) {

    }
```

Using the DeviceApi or DeviceApiWeb as shown above will:

* Automatically optimize the data file (datafile.json).
* Automatically sense a newer data file when the data file is replaced or changed
  and will optimize the new data file and renew the optimization cache.
* The API will use the cached data files for optimized device lookups when they
  are available.

Note: as soon as the API senses a new data file, it will perform an optimization
process on it's usage. This means that, in a web application, the first request
after a data file update will experience a small lag. If you wish to eliminate
this lag, you may manually run the optimization process using a command line tool
which comes with the API package.

```php
php ExtraTools/DeviceApiCache/data-file-optimizer.php -c /path/to/datafile.json
```

Using this command line tool you can also perform the following actions:

* Get a small speed and memory usage analysis report by comparing the data file
  with the optimized data file.

```php
php ExtraTools/DeviceApiCache/data-file-optimizer.php -a /path/to/datafile.json
```

* Clear the optimization cache files of a data file.

```php
php ExtraTools/DeviceApiCache/data-file-optimizer.php -d /path/to/datafile.json
```

If you want to manually update the optimization caches with the command line tool
then you may want to turn off the DeviceApi data file change checking which would
be unnecessary:

```php
    $config = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_Config();
    $config->setUseTreeOptimizer(true);
    $config->setIgnoreDataFileChanges(true);

    $deviceApi = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_DeviceApiWeb($config);

    try {
        $deviceApi->loadDataFromFile("/path/to/datafile.json");
    } catch (Exception $x) {

    }
```


By default the optimized data caches will be put inside the system temp directory,
however you can change this temp/cache directory:

```php
    $config = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_Config();
    $config->setUseTreeOptimizer(true);
    $config->setOptimizerTempDir('/path/to/my/temp-directory');

    $deviceApi = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_DeviceApiWeb($config);

    try {
        $deviceApi->loadDataFromFile("/path/to/datafile.json");
    } catch (Exception $x) {

    }
```

The custom temp directory, if implemented, must always be passed to the command
line tool as shown below:

```php
    php ExtraTools/DeviceApiCache/data-file-optimizer.php -c /path/to/datafile.json -t /custom/temp-directory

    php ExtraTools/DeviceApiCache/data-file-optimizer.php -a /path/to/datafile.json -t /custom/temp-directory

    php ExtraTools/DeviceApiCache/data-file-optimizer.php -d /path/to/datafile.json -t /custom/temp-directory
```


#### Using Cache Providers ####
While the DeviceAtlas API lookups are very fast, caching the lookup results will
eliminate repeated unnecessary future lookups. Currently there are three cache
providers available APC, Memcache and file-cache. The API can be configured to
cache the results for a request, header set or user-agent. For future requests
the API will return the cached results if they exists.

```php
    $config = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_Config();

    require_once '/path/to/Api/CacheProvider/ApcCacheProvider.php';
    $config->setCacheProvider(new Mobi_Mtld_DA_CacheProvider_ApcCacheProvider());

    $deviceApi = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_DeviceApiWeb($config);

    /* (2) load the data file */
    try {
        $deviceApi->loadDataFromFile("/path/to/datafile.json");

    } catch (Exception $x) {

    }
```

The default cache expiry time is 86400 seconds, which is one day. To change this
time limit, pass the new value to the cache provider constructor like this:

```php
    $config = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_Config();

    require_once '/path/to/Api/CacheProvider/ApcCacheProvider.php';
    $config->setCacheProvider(new Mobi_Mtld_DA_CacheProvider_ApcCacheProvider(604800));
```

If you want to use a cache provider that is not available within the DeviceAtlas
package:

Create a class that implements the
Mobi_Mtld_DA_CacheProvider_CacheProviderInterface located in
/path/to/Api/CacheProvider/CacheProviderInterface.php


#### Using both optimizations together ####
The two optimizations are not related to each other, you may use only one of the
optimizations or both together. We recommend using both optimizations in a web
application.

```php
    require_once '/path/to/Api/CacheProvider/ApcCacheProvider.php';

    $config = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_Config();
    $config->setUseTreeOptimizer(true);
    $config->setCacheProvider(new Mobi_Mtld_DA_CacheProvider_ApcCacheProvider);
    $deviceApi = new Mobi_Mtld_DA_Device_DeviceApiWeb($config);

    /* (2) load the data file */
    try {
        $deviceApi->loadDataFromFile("/path/to/datafile.json");

    } catch (Exception $x) {

    }
```
